# Flight log

Running log for the multi-step work started 2026-09-25 ("complete all the
next steps"). If a session is interrupted, read this file top to bottom,
then continue from **Next action**. Entries are appended, never rewritten.

Status markers: `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done and
verified · `[!]` blocked, needs a human (reason given) · `[p]` prepared for a
human; the human part is still open. Nothing is marked `[x]` unless it was
actually done. Items that belong to a person (the H-items) are never marked
done by Claude, only `[p]`.

## Environment notes (for resuming)

- Local R: use `C:\Program Files\R\R-4.3.3\bin\Rscript.exe` (4.3.3 has every
  package; 4.6.1 has none). In Git Bash:
  `RS="/c/Program Files/R/R-4.3.3/bin/Rscript.exe"`,
  `RCMD="/c/Program Files/R/R-4.3.3/bin/R.exe"`.
- Raw 311 cache from 2026-09-23: `data/cache/311/raw.rds`.
- Commits go straight to `main` (user preference). **Nothing is pushed
  without asking the user.** Pushing to `main` triggers `deploy-site`.

## Plan

Order follows the "next steps" list, except 3b runs first: the USPS branch
adds D21, so it has to land before any new D-entry to avoid an ID clash.

| # | Step | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Baseline: package, 311 and poller tests pass locally | [x] |
| 3b | USPS branch: review, then merge into local `main` (or recommend deletion) | [x] merged locally; remote branch deletion left to user |
| 1 | 311 reconciliation: find an official figure, record a D-entry, wire it into the gate | [ ] |
| 2a | H10 spec freeze: pre-review packet for the 311 specs | [ ] |
| 2b | H3 manual audit: 100-record sample with an automated source trace | [ ] |
| 2c | H20 golden file: independent recomputation of sample rows | [ ] |
| 2d | H9 reference ZIPs: evidence packet | [ ] |
| 2e | H6 geocoder check: draw the 200-address sample, automated comparison | [ ] |
| 2f | H7 reviewer: outreach draft | [ ] |
| 2g | H8 courtesy preview: letter draft | [ ] |
| 3a | H11 follow-up: letter draft for use after 2026-10-02 | [ ] |
| 4a | Permits pipeline (Phase 4) | [ ] |
| 4b | Food-safety ingest against the expected export (D13) | [ ] |
| 4c | H19: MLGW spec revision draft | [ ] |
| 4d | MATA trip matching (Phase 5) | [ ] |

## Log

### 2026-09-25

- 19:00 CT. Log created. Local R 4.3.3 found with all packages; 4.6.1 has
  none. Starting step 0.
- 19:10 CT. Step 0 done. memequity tests pass, 311 tests pass (after
  `R CMD INSTALL packages/memequity`), pollers 11/11 pass. pytest is not in
  the global Python 3.14, so there is a throwaway venv in the session
  scratchpad (`.../scratchpad/venv`); recreate it with
  `python -m venv <dir>` + `pip install -r pollers/requirements.txt pytest`.

- 19:20 CT. Step 3b done. Read the USPS note (245 lines, consistent with
  plan 12 and D11) and D21 (records the owner's own 2026-09-25 decision).
  Fast-forwarded local `main` to `1f83bbe`. The remote branch
  `claude/usps-service-performance-uwwldp` can be deleted once `main` is
  pushed; that is the user's call. New D-entries start at **D22**.

## Next action

Step 1: research whether the City of Memphis publishes an official 311
figure we can reconcile against (counts by type or month, not on-time %).
Start from `docs/research/311-permits-districts.md`.
